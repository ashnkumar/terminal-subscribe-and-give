   * * Searchable attribute and objects queryable by searchable attributes **
   * - `name`:  `CatalogItem`, `CatalogItemVariation`, `CatalogCategory`, `CatalogTax`, `CatalogDiscount`, `CatalogModifier`, 'CatalogModifierList`, `CatalogItemOption`, `CatalogItemOptionValue`

   * - `upc`: `CatalogItemVariation`
   * - `sku`: `CatalogItemVariation`
   * - `caption`: `CatalogImage`
   * - `display_name`: `CatalogItemOption`
