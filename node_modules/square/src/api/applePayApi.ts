   * Apple Pay on the Web with Square for merchants using their platform.
   *
   * Note: The SqPaymentForm library is deprecated as of May 13, 2021, and will only receive critical
   * security updates until it is retired on October 31, 2022.
   * You must migrate your payment form code to the Web Payments SDK to continue using your domain for
   * Apple Pay. For more information on migrating to the Web Payments SDK, see [Migrate to the Web
   * Payments SDK](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/migrate).
   *
   * To learn more about the Web Payments SDK and how to add Apple Pay, see [Take an Apple Pay
   * Payment](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/apple-pay).
